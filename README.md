LD28
====

This is the repository for the game I'll be making for Ludum Dare #28
I'll try to commit something hourly, but I'll probably leave them till the end of the day since I'm lazy like that...

If you can fight your way through the tears you'll get from seeing my terrible code and/or art, then you deserve to be able do whatever you want with them.
